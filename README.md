goals
=====

This project has three main goals:

* Be a reference for others who want to see a complete website and how things can be done for it when
  * using current technology (node, react.js, flux, webpack, bootstrap, ...)
  * testing (in different ways like unit tests, functional tests, mocking)
* Be a playground and a challenge for me and everyone else involved in this
* Be an interesting website in the future
